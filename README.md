# Belgium-Bike-Thief-Catcher
Downloads all metadata, including picture of bikes sold on www.2ememain.be or www.2dehand.be so you can more easily find your stolen bike.

# Instructions
In the project folder, add a 'Photos/Suspect' and a 'Photos/Not_suspect' folders. As you go through downloaded pictures, move them in batches to one of these folders. Photos of bikes found in these folders won't be downloaded again so you get a clean 'Photos' folder with only unprocessed bikes.
